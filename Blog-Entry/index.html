        <h1>Ricardo's Blog</h1>
        <p>Hello from outerspace! My name is Ricardo Hernandez and I'm going to be writing a blog post in HTML</p>
        <!--Insert info about myself such as my name, my age, my school, 
            a picture of myself and what my goals are for development-->
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src = "selfie.jpg" height ="30%" width = "30%">
        <p>My name is Ricardo Hernandez, and I'm a 19 year old student currently attending <br> Montgomery College in
            Rockville, MD. I first began programming a few years ago while <br>in High School, and HTML/CSS was one of
            the first language I used while in freshman<br> year. While web development isn't my dream career (I want to work
            in software development),<br> hopefully this will prepare me for developing software. I can already basic C++ and<br>
            I want to learn more.
        </p>
        <!--Insert info about interest 1: Music-->
        <h2>Interest: Music</h2>
        <p>Although I don't listen to as much music as I <em>used</em> to, I still listen to music all the time<br>and I am open to
        discovering new music. Here are my three favorite songs of the moment.<br> You can listen to the song by clicking the album art</p>

        <!--Insert info about interest 2: Swimming-->
        <h2>Interest: Swimming</h2>
        <p>Another interest I have is swimming. I have been going to LA Fitness to swim and seeing my <br>progress over time has been interesting.
        When I first started going in September 2022, I <br>couldn't even make it an entire pool length without having to stop for breath. Eventually,<br>I began
        to use a snorkle when swimming just so I could improve my form and it worked.<br>I can now swim hundreds of meters (my record being a little above 1 mile)
        at a time. <br>I want to learn how to side stroke.</p>
